# odin-recipes
recipe website
In this project I will showcase all of the coding skills i have learned thus far from the odin projects foundations course. 

these skills involve basic html commands such as 
1. inserting images.
2. inserting both absolute and relative links.
3. inserting ordered and unordered lists.
4. using git commits

I realize now that I have failed to properly make use of my git commits. I was so focused on building the website that i skipped over the part in the instructions where it explains commiting early and often. In the next project i will be sure to commit more often.
