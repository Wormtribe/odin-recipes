       <h2>This vegan fettuccine alfredo tastes decadent, 
        but the creamy sauce is filled with healthy plant based ingredients. 
        An easy dinner in under 30 minutes!</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine noodles</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 small head cauliflower (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup raw unsalted cashews</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/8 + ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Finely chopped parsley, to serve</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>  
        <li>Mince the garlic. Chop the cauliflower.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
            Boil the pasta until it is al dente (start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends: you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside). 
            Then drain the pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, start the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven, pot, or saucepan (that has a cover) over medium heat. 
            Add the cauliflower and cashews and saute for 4 minutes until lightly browned. 
            Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. 
            Add the vegetable broth, onion powder, black pepper, nutmeg and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. 
            Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 6 to 7 minutes on medium high heat until the cauliflower is tender when pierced with a fork.</li>
        <li>Blend the sauce: Carefully transfer the contents to a blender and add the remaining ½ teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon more black pepper. 
            Blend on high until a smooth sauce forms.</li>
        <li>Serve: Pour about 5 cups into 1 pound pasta (1 cup will be left over), or use it to taste. 
            Top with finely chopped parsley and serve immediately.
        </li>

    </ol>
