       <h2>This broccoli potato soup is intensely creamy, satisfying, and 100% plant based! It’s an easy healthy soup that everyone loves.</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
    <ul>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes (about 6 medium)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable broth</li>
        <li>½ cup raw unsalted cashews</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen broccoli florets (or 4 cups small steamed broccoli florets*)</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon dried dill</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>  
        <li>Dice the onion. Mince the garlic. Peel the potatoes and cut them into bite-sized chunks.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. 
            Add the vegetable broth, cashews and potatoes and ½ teaspoon kosher salt and bring to a boil. 
            Reduce to a rapid simmer (not a boil), and simmer about 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender and falling apart when poked with a fork.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, run the frozen broccoli under hot water to thaw it. Chop it into smaller florets as necessary. All packages are different, so make small bite-sized florets the size you’d like for a soup. 
            You can chop the broccoli stems off and keep them in the soup as well. 
            Place the broccoli in a bowl and mix it with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and black pepper to taste. 
            Peel and grate the carrot into long strips (we used a handheld julienne shredder).</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are tender, use a ladle to transfer everything to a blender. 
            Add the thyme, dill, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and another ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. 
            Hold the top tight and blend everything for a minute or two until fully creamy. 
            (This quantity just fits in a standard blender.)</li>
        <li>Pour the creamy soup back into the pot and add the broccoli and carrot. 
            Simmer about 5 more minutes until the broccoli is cooked through. 
            Taste and add additional salt as necessary (we added ¼ teaspoon more).</li>

    </ol>
