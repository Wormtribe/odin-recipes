       <h2>This simple red lentil soup recipe is bursting with flavor! 
        It’s hearty and cozy, flavored with aromatic vegetables and lemon.</h2>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
    <ul>
        <li>3 large carrots</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 celery ribs</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound split red lentils</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Cilantro, for serving</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>  
        <li>Peel the carrots. 
            Finely dice the carrot, onion, and celery. 
            Mince the garlic.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the liive oil over medium heat. 
            Add the onion, carrots and celery, and sauté until the carrots are tender, 
            about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. 
            Add the broth, water, red lentils, smoked paprika, 
            lemon zest, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a low simmer, then cover halfway and gently simmer until the lentils are just soft but before they start to break apart, about 7 to 10 minutes. 
            Watch closely and taste to assess doneness. 
            The finished soup should be brothy with the lentils just soft; cooking past this point yields a very thick stew which is just as delicious but less soup-like. 
            (If you’d like, you can add handflis of greens in the last few minutes, like chopped spinach or kale).</li>
        <li>Taste and add additional salt to taste, and a few grinds black pepper. 
            Leftovers can become very thick, so you can add a little water or broth when reheating.</li>

    </ol>
